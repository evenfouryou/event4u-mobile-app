SEND TEST REPORT FOR UNUSED DATE AND VERIFY 0000 RESPONSE                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                           
  Send a fresh RMG report for date 2026-01-18 (or 2026-01-17 if 18 is already used).                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                           
  Check the database first to confirm the date has zero prior transmissions.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                           
  Send the report using the debug endpoint.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                           
  Monitor the database for 10 minutes checking every minute for the SIAE response.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                           
  Expected result: responseCode should be 0000 (success) since this is a clean first submission with correct date coherence and fixed response handler.

  - The SIAE response code received                                                                                                                        
  - Time taken to receive response                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                           
  If you get 0000, all systems are working correctly and both the date coherence fix (0603) and response handler fix are confirmed successful.
